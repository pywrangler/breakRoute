Resolved issues:
    removing unnessesary loops; unnesecary loops removed
    check if gives same output as before after removing unnesecary loops: yes gives same output
    check if there is any imporvement in processing time: seems no improvement and even might have increased the time because
    all routes are getting passed to the functions
    Remove local trains from database to solve local station bug
    removing local trains did not solve local station bug: consider reinstiating local trains
    
    Solve local station bug: this bug seems solved after adding half train ranking(not including local trains)
    giving extra point to stations with more trains which complete only halfroute; added this feature: seems to solve local stn bug
    filter station list to improve speed; station list already filtered;speed not improved
    
    from adding  length+100*lentgth now only adding length
    storing length and reusing it
    Consider including local stations:check performance after half route ranking feature;local trains do not create much difference

pending issues:
    
    
    check each high ranking station
